In order to avoid reinventing an already existing wheel for tailing logfiles, this tail module was copied from
the awesome beaver project by Jose Diaz-Gonzalez. If you need a more sophisticated approach for tailing logfiles
than the simple file input module packaged with LumberMill, be sure to visit https://github.com/python-beaver/python-beaver
and https://python-beaver.readthedocs.org/.
